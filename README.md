# JSA Website

## Overview
Everything is supposed to be static. Any framework may be chosen in the future if feasible.
For now, JSON is acting as a virtual database and jQuery renders contents dynamically. It's like MVC with:
* M = JSON
* V = HTML
* C = jQuery

## Note
### Email list
1. User sign up via google form
2. User info store in google spreadsheet
3. Zapier automatically add the user as a new contact on gmail account under "Subscribers"

### JSON
A local JSON file cannot be read, and I don't know why. You have to upload it to cloud every time you change it even during development.
